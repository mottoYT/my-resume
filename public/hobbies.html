<h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
<p>i've been an on/off guitar player ever since i was 8. i always had a hard time learning things and ended up quitting. But for the last year i've been playing nonstop! i'm able to play songs that i love and things i regarded impossible! i don't think i'm ever putting the guitar down again!</p>
<p>My inspirations for playing guitar are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Frank Iero (My Chemical romance, LS Dunes)</li>

<p>I don't know if you can tell by the pictures but i really like Les Paul guitars!</p>

<h2>Attending Concerts</h2>
<p>it may not come as a surprise, but i like concerts lol, they are the moment when nothing matters anymore and you are one with the music and the artist. Concerts are where i feel at ease, where i belong.</p>
<p>Some of the best concerts i've been to are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Twenty One Pilots 2022/2023</li>

    <li>Evanescence 2023</li>

    <li>Bring Me The Horizon 2024</li>
    <img src="../Assets/bmth.jpg" height="200">
    <p>The band i've seen the most is Trotsky Vengaran! Not sure how many exactly but around 5 or 6 times! They are a Uruguayan punk rock band and one of my favorites. I go see them every chance i get.</p>
